This is a Reactjs project that takes a productID parameter from the user and queries multiple APIs to gather product information and pricing data.

## Getting Started

- First you need to have Nodejs and NPM installed in your system. These can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

- Next step is the pull the code from github. This can be done by adding this repository as upstream by typing 'git remote add upstream

  <address of the repo> followed by a 'git pull'. The other way is to download a zip of the codebase from github.

- Next step is to navigate to the project directory and type 'npm intall axios bootstrap --save' to install the dependecies.

- Final step is to type 'npm start' to initiate the application.

## Testing the HTTP GET REQUEST

- First start the application by following the steps above and then type in a productID in the textfield of the application interface.

- Click the 'look up' button

- Open the console the web browser. This can be done by right clicking on the browser body and clicking 'inspect element'

- The console will print the result in JSON format.

## Testing the HTTP PUT REQUEST

- Start the application
- Type in the productID and the new price.
- Press the 'update' button
- This will console log the updated record.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
